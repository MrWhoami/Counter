This is a small counter written in Python 2 with appJar to practice GUI programming in Python. 

For appJar, see <http://appjar.info/>. You need to install Python and appJar first.

To run, type `python Counter.py`. To run multiple counters, run the following commands as many times as you want: `python Counter.py &` with bash or `Start-Process -NoNewWindow python Counter.py` with Powershell Ver.2.

## TODO
- [x] Customize value
- [x] Add keyboard support
- [ ] Save and load
- [x] Support more than one counters (Run multiple instance instead)
- [ ] Can set goal and display in percentage
